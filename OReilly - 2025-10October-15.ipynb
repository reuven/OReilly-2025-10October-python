    "When computers were first invented, each computer that was put together solved a differnet problem. That's a very expensive way to solve problems! Pretty quickly, people realized that it would be better to create a single, general-purpose computer that could solve many different problems. You could program that computer with 1s and 0s, what are known as \"binary numbers.\" Writing programs in this way is very difficult, and fixing/maintaining programs written in this way is even more difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty quickly, people created \"programming languages.\" You write your instructions in your language, and those are translated into binary code that the computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C -- is very similar to the binary code that the computer uses. The good news is that C code runs very quickly. The bad news is that writing and maintaining it is very difficult.\n",
    "- C++ -- C with extra \"object-oriented\" capabilities. It's far more complex than C!\n",
