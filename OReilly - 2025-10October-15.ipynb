    "# What is a programming language? What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were first invented, each computer that was put together solved a differnet problem. That's a very expensive way to solve problems! Pretty quickly, people realized that it would be better to create a single, general-purpose computer that could solve many different problems. You could program that computer with 1s and 0s, what are known as \"binary numbers.\" Writing programs in this way is very difficult, and fixing/maintaining programs written in this way is even more difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty quickly, people created \"programming languages.\" You write your instructions in your language, and those are translated into binary code that the computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C -- is very similar to the binary code that the computer uses. The good news is that C code runs very quickly. The bad news is that writing and maintaining it is very difficult.\n",
    "- C++ -- C with extra \"object-oriented\" capabilities. It's far more complex than C!\n",
    "- Java -- was designed to be a much easier-than-C++ sort of language, and it is! But it's still complex. It's higher level than C and C++, so it feels more like a human language. But it's still hard for many people to learn\n",
    "- Python -- was designed to be easy to write, read, and maintain. Those are more important values in the Python world than execution speed. Python is a perfect language for a world where computers are cheap, but people are expensive. It's intended to be friendly and useful. It is run by the community, not owned by any company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been around for more than 30 years! It has now become popular because there are a lot of applications where it hits the sweet spot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- machine learning and AI\n",
    "- data analysis\n",

    "- Web applications\n",
    "- API servers/clients\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "- Testing and automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people (especially programmers!) believe that because Python has simpler syntax than many other languages, and because it runs a bit more slowly, it isn't a serious language. This is *NOT TRUE*. Python is a very serious language, used in lots of places and applications. But it's a different kind of language than C, Java, etc.\n",
