    "That's *not* actually what we're saying to Python!\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, nearly all values can be evaluated in what I call \"boolean context,\" meaning that they are forced to provide a `True` or `False` value. This is especially the case in `if`, `or`, and `and`.\n",

    "- Nearly every value in Python, when asked if it's `True` or `False` in that context (i.e., in an `if`, `and`, or `or`) will return `True`.\n",
    "- The exceptions are 0, `None`, and any empty value, such as the empty string, `''`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    text[0] == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u'\n",

    "    - If not, the loop exits with an error\n",
    "2. Assuming that the value is iterable, Python turns to the iterable, and says: What is your next value?\n",
    "    - If it's out of values, then the loop exits (with no error), and the program continues after the loop body\n",
    "3. If we get a value, then it is assigned to the loop variable (`one_character`, in this case)\n",

    "The fact that I called the loop variable `one_character` has *ZERO* influence on what we get back with each iteration. The name of the variable is important to me, as a person, writing and maintaining the code. From Python's perspective, I could call it `tomato`, `one_terabyte`, or `my_favorite_uncle`. All would work exactly the same way.\n",
