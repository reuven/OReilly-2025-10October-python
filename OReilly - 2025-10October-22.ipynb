    "\n",
    "We know, then, that the condition we've given is always returning `True`, no matter what.\n",

    "\n",
    "That's *not* actually what we're saying to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "`and` and `or` are not for selecting from different options for `==`. Rather, `and` and `or` look to their left for a `True` or `False`, and look to their right for ar `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `and` returns `True` if the items on its left and right are both `True`\n",
    "- `or` returns `True` if either of the items on its left or right are `True`\n",

    "What does it mean to have a condition of just one letter, a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, nearly all values can be evaluated in what I call \"boolean context,\" meaning that they are forced to provide a `True` or `False` value. This is especially the case in `if`, `or`, and `and`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nearly every value in Python, when asked if it's `True` or `False` in that context (i.e., in an `if`, `and`, or `or`) will return `True`.\n",
    "- The exceptions are 0, `None`, and any empty value, such as the empty string, `''`\n",
    "\n",
    "So our `if` condition looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    text[0] == 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u'\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, it will *always* be `True`!\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that we can avoid this is by having a full comparison on either side of `or`:\n",

    "    text[0] == 'a' or text[0] == 'e' or text[0] == 'i' or text[0] == 'o' or text[0] == 'u'\n",
