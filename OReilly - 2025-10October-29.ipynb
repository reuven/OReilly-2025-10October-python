    "# What's happening in the above code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `for` turns to the value at the end of the line, which is `enumerate(s)`.\n",
    "2. `enumerate` is a builtin function that is designed for use inside of a `for` loop, and can only take an argument that is itself iterable. (So yes to strings, lists, and tuples. No to integers.)\n",
    "3. `for` asks `enumerate(s)`: Are you iterable? The answer is \"yes.\"\n",
    "4. Repeatedly, `for` asks `enumerate(s)` to give us the next value.\n",
    "5. In this case, the value of each iteration is a 2-element tuple. The first element is the index, starting with 0. The second item is the value from `s` (what `enumerate` is wrapping) that is associated with that index. In other words, we'll get `(0, 'a')`, `(1, 'b')`, `(2, 'c')`, and `(3, 'd')`.\n",
    "6. Because we're running the `for` loop with two loop variables, Python uses \"tuple unpacking\" to take the two elements of our tuple and assign them in parallel to the two variables. So if the current loop value is `(0, 'a')`, then `index` will be assigned `0`, and `one_character` will be assigned `'a'`.\n",
    "7. The loop body runs\n",
    "8. We go back to step 4, stopping when we run out of values."

    "\n",
    "You can think of a dict as a list in which we control the index. And the index can be just about any value. In a list, we are stuck with the indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and we know that the final value will be at `len(mylist) - 1`. In a dict, we can use any values we want for keys, and they can be in any order. Yes, this means we can use *strings* as keys. \n",
