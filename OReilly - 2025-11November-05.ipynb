We've already seen a lot of those. (For these purposes, I'm lumping functions and methods into the same category.)\n",

    "\n",
    "We could write any code we want, and do anything we want, just using the functions that come with Python. That would work, even if it would be annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that means remaining at a very low level, one that is close to how Python works, but not necessarily how we think. In order to come closer to how we think, we need to write our own functions, ones that bundle together a number of pieces of lower-level functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of writing functions is thus to think at a higher level, to allow us to write programs that are closer to how we think, not closer to how the computer thinks.\n",

We're not going to discuss this in too much depth, but it is important to mention that if you want to execute a function, you must use `()` after its name. Without the `()`, you will be referring to the function's definition, or the function \"object,\" as we say, but not to the result of executing the function.\n",

The rules for naming functions are the same as for naming variables. You cannot have both a function and a variable named the same thing at the same time -- the later one to be defined \"wins.\""
