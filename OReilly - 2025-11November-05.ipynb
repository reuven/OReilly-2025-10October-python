We've already seen a lot of those. (For these purposes, I'm lumping functions and methods into the same category.)\n",

    "\n",
    "But that means remaining at a very low level, one that is close to how Python works, but not necessarily how we think. In order to come closer to how we think, we need to write our own functions, ones that bundle together a number of pieces of lower-level functionality.\n",
