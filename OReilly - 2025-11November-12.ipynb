    "# How does `for` give us different values when iterating over different iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that `for` loops work differently with different types of values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With strings, we get each character, one at a time\n",
    "- With lists and tuples, we get each element, one at a time\n",
    "- With dicts, we get each key, one at a time,\n",
    "- With files, we get each line, one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "How, without saying much, does the `for` loop work differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is in the conversation that it has with the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for one_item in thing:\n",
    "    print(one_item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `for` will turn to `thing` and ask: Are you iterable? So long as the value says \"yes,\" the `for` loop believes it. Then, with each iteration, the `for` loop asks `thing` for its next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop has no idea how many values it'll get, or what they will be. It's all up to the `thing` with which it's speaking. This is very different from many other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of iterable in Python knows what it will give with each iteration when `for` asks for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification of this conversation is known as a \"protocol.\" THere are lots of protocols in programming. In Python, the \"iterator protocol\" is one of the most famous and one of the most widely implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I say, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for one_line in open('myfile.txt'):     # this for loop is iterating over a file, which gives it one line at a time\n",
    "    for one_character in one_line:      # this for loop is iterating over a string (one_line), which gives one character at a time\n",
