    "# How does `for` give us different values when iterating over different iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that `for` loops work differently with different types of values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With strings, we get each character, one at a time\n",
    "- With lists and tuples, we get each element, one at a time\n",
    "- With dicts, we get each key, one at a time,\n",
    "- With files, we get each line, one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "How, without saying much, does the `for` loop work differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is in the conversation that it has with the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for one_item in thing:\n",
    "    print(one_item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `for` will turn to `thing` and ask: Are you iterable? So long as the value says \"yes,\" the `for` loop believes it. Then, with each iteration, the `for` loop asks `thing` for its next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop has no idea how many values it'll get, or what they will be. It's all up to the `thing` with which it's speaking. This is very different from many other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of iterable in Python knows what it will give with each iteration when `for` asks for it.\n",

    "# What are modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked several times about the \"DRY rule\" in programming. That stands for \"Don't repeat yourself!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen several examples of how we can \"DRY up\" our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the same line repeats (more or less) several times in a row, we can replace it with a loop.\n",
    "2. If the same code repeats (more or less) in several places in our program, we can replace it with a function.\n",
    "3. If the same code repeats (more or less) in several different programs, we can put that code into a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are in just about every programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries \"modules.\" A module basically does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything I just described about a library, allowing us to package up data and function definitions so that we can use them later on, or share them with colleagues/friends.\n",
    "2. Modules also provide us with \"namespaces,\" a fancy way of saying that we will give last names to our variables. This ensures that if two people are working on different parts of a program, and both use the variable `x`, these variables won't step on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit more terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module, as we'll see, is implemented in a single file.\n",
    "- A \"package\" is a directory/folder containing one or more modules."

    "3. The name to the right of `import` is not a string! It's not the name of a file! It's the name of the variable we want to assign the module we have loaded. In this way, it's similar to `def`, which defines functions. Here, we say what module we want to have loaded, and from that name, Python figures out what file to load, and where it is. This means that you *don't* give `import` a string!\n",
    "4. There isn't a standard, easy way to `import` a particular file. Rather, Python has conventions for how module names and filenames are related, and where Python will look for your modules."
